# Real Estate Model Pilot

This is a NextJs project, created to be a model of a Real Estate site, I'm developing it to match on my portfolio, so let's start with the technologies:

- TypeScript
- NextJs
- ReactJs
- Chakra UI
- Zod + React Hook Form

## Plans

The project is designed to be a **Serverless Application**, and will work only to demonstrate my Front-End development abilities.

## Access

The project is deployed on [Vercel PLatform](https://real-estate-model-pilot.vercel.app/) if you want to see how it's going on.
